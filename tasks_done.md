# Completed Tasks Log

## Task 1.1: Refactor `main()` Function
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve modularity and readability by breaking down the `main()` function in `main.py` into smaller, focused functions.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   The `main()` function in `main.py` was refactored into several smaller, single-responsibility functions as per the detailed instructions in `tasks.md`.
    *   Created `parse_arguments()` for CLI argument processing and validation.
    *   Created `get_terminal_dimensions()` for acquiring terminal size.
    *   Created `initialize_animation_parameters()` for setting up characters, colors (as a dictionary), and column states.
    *   Created `update_column_states()` for managing the logic of rain drop progression.
    *   Created `render_frame_buffer()` for constructing the visual output for each frame.
    *   Created `run_animation_loop()` to encapsulate the main animation loop, coordinating calls to update states and render frames.
    *   The main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) was updated to orchestrate calls to these new functions and handle `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful exit.
*   **Outcome:** `main.py` is now more organized, with improved readability and maintainability. This modular structure will facilitate future enhancements and debugging.

## Task 2.1: Optimize String Concatenation
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve performance of frame rendering by using `"".join()` instead of repeated string concatenation for rows.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Identified the `render_frame_buffer()` function in `main.py`.
    *   Modified the frame rendering loop within this function.
    *   Instead of building row strings by repeated concatenation (`row_str += ...`), each row is now constructed by appending character segments to a list (`char_list`).
    *   After processing all characters for a row, `"".join(char_list)` is used to create the final row string.
*   **Outcome:** Reduced CPU usage and potentially smoother animation, especially on systems where string concatenation is slow or for larger terminal sizes. The change improves the efficiency of frame generation.

## Task 3.1: Enhanced Terminal Size Detection (with CLI Override)
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Provide a more robust way to handle terminal size, allowing users to override detected dimensions if necessary.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Added command-line arguments `--width` and `--height` to `main.py`. These allow users to manually specify the terminal dimensions.
    *   Implemented validation in `parse_arguments()` to ensure that if one override is provided, both must be, and that they are positive integers. Errors cause the script to exit with a message.
    *   Modified the `get_terminal_dimensions(args)` function to prioritize these user-supplied dimensions. If not provided, it attempts `os.get_terminal_size()`. If that fails, it falls back to default dimensions (80x24) with a warning.
*   **Reasoning:** This enhancement improves the script's usability and reliability, especially for users in environments where automatic terminal size detection (`os.get_terminal_size()`) might fail or provide inaccurate results. Giving users manual control ensures the animation can be displayed correctly.
*   **Outcome:** Users can now explicitly define terminal width and height via CLI arguments, making the script more robust and adaptable to various terminal environments or when automatic detection is problematic.

## Refactor: Modularize `main.py`
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability by splitting `main.py` into smaller, focused modules.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Created `config.py`:
        *   Moved `parse_arguments()` function here.
        *   Defined `AnsiColors` Enum for managing ANSI escape codes (fulfilling Task 1.2).
        *   Moved static character set definitions (`DEFAULT_CHAR_SETS`) here.
    *   Created `terminal_utils.py`:
        *   Moved `get_terminal_dimensions()` function here.
    *   Created `animation_core.py`:
        *   Moved core animation logic functions: `initialize_animation_parameters()`, `update_column_states()`, `render_frame_buffer()`, and `run_animation_loop()`.
        *   Updated these functions to use `AnsiColors` and `DEFAULT_CHAR_SETS` from `config.py`.
    *   Refactored `main.py`:
        *   Removed moved functions and definitions.
        *   Added imports for the new modules.
        *   The main execution block now orchestrates calls to the imported functions.
        *   Corrected ANSI escape codes in `AnsiColors` Enum to use literal escape characters.
*   **Reasoning:** The `main.py` script was becoming lengthy. Separating concerns into different modules makes the codebase easier to understand, navigate, and maintain. This also facilitates future enhancements.
*   **Outcome:** Improved code modularity and organization. `main.py` is now significantly shorter and acts as an entry point, while specialized logic resides in `config.py`, `terminal_utils.py`, and `animation_core.py`. Task 1.2 was also completed as part of this refactoring.

## Task 1.2: Organize ANSI Color Constants
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Make ANSI escape code constants more manageable and descriptive using an `Enum`.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Defined an `AnsiColors` Enum in `config.py`. This Enum includes members for standard colors like `WHITE`, `GREEN`, `BRIGHT_GREEN`, `RESET`, and other colors for themes.
    *   The `initialize_animation_parameters()` and `render_frame_buffer()` functions in `animation_core.py`, as well as the `KeyboardInterrupt` handler in `main.py`, were updated to use values from this `AnsiColors` Enum (e.g., `AnsiColors.RESET.value`).
    *   The previous global string constants for colors in `main.py` were removed as their roles are now fulfilled by the Enum.
*   **Reasoning:** Centralizing color definitions in an Enum improves code readability, makes color management easier, and reduces the risk of errors from typos in string literals. It also prepares for more advanced theme customization.
*   **Outcome:** ANSI color codes are now managed by the `AnsiColors` Enum in `config.py`, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
