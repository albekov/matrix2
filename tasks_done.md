# Completed Tasks Log

## Task 1.1: Refactor `main()` Function
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve modularity and readability by breaking down the `main()` function in `main.py` into smaller, focused functions.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   The `main()` function in `main.py` was refactored into several smaller, single-responsibility functions as per the detailed instructions in `tasks.md`.
    *   Created `parse_arguments()` for CLI argument processing and validation.
    *   Created `get_terminal_dimensions()` for acquiring terminal size.
    *   Created `initialize_animation_parameters()` for setting up characters, colors (as a dictionary), and column states.
    *   Created `update_column_states()` for managing the logic of rain drop progression.
    *   Created `render_frame_buffer()` for constructing the visual output for each frame.
    *   Created `run_animation_loop()` to encapsulate the main animation loop, coordinating calls to update states and render frames.
    *   The main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) was updated to orchestrate calls to these new functions and handle `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful exit.
*   **Outcome:** `main.py` is now more organized, with improved readability and maintainability. This modular structure will facilitate future enhancements and debugging.

## Task 2.1: Optimize String Concatenation
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve performance of frame rendering by using `"".join()` instead of repeated string concatenation for rows.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Identified the `render_frame_buffer()` function in `main.py`.
    *   Modified the frame rendering loop within this function.
    *   Instead of building row strings by repeated concatenation (`row_str += ...`), each row is now constructed by appending character segments to a list (`char_list`).
    *   After processing all characters for a row, `"".join(char_list)` is used to create the final row string.
*   **Outcome:** Reduced CPU usage and potentially smoother animation, especially on systems where string concatenation is slow or for larger terminal sizes. The change improves the efficiency of frame generation.

## Task 3.1: Enhanced Terminal Size Detection (with CLI Override)
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Provide a more robust way to handle terminal size, allowing users to override detected dimensions if necessary.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   Added command-line arguments `--width` and `--height` to `main.py`. These allow users to manually specify the terminal dimensions.
    *   Implemented validation in `parse_arguments()` to ensure that if one override is provided, both must be, and that they are positive integers. Errors cause the script to exit with a message.
    *   Modified the `get_terminal_dimensions(args)` function to prioritize these user-supplied dimensions. If not provided, it attempts `os.get_terminal_size()`. If that fails, it falls back to default dimensions (80x24) with a warning.
*   **Reasoning:** This enhancement improves the script's usability and reliability, especially for users in environments where automatic terminal size detection (`os.get_terminal_size()`) might fail or provide inaccurate results. Giving users manual control ensures the animation can be displayed correctly.
*   **Outcome:** Users can now explicitly define terminal width and height via CLI arguments, making the script more robust and adaptable to various terminal environments or when automatic detection is problematic.
