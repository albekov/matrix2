# Completed Tasks Log

## Task 1.1: Refactor `main()` Function
*   **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Objective:** Improve modularity and readability by breaking down the `main()` function in `main.py` into smaller, focused functions.
*   **Summary of Implementation:**
    *   The `main()` function in `main.py` was refactored into several smaller, single-responsibility functions as per the detailed instructions in `tasks.md`.
    *   Created `parse_arguments()` for CLI argument processing and validation.
    *   Created `get_terminal_dimensions()` for acquiring terminal size.
    *   Created `initialize_animation_parameters()` for setting up characters, colors (as a dictionary), and column states.
    *   Created `update_column_states()` for managing the logic of rain drop progression.
    *   Created `render_frame_buffer()` for constructing the visual output for each frame.
    *   Created `run_animation_loop()` to encapsulate the main animation loop, coordinating calls to update states and render frames.
    *   The main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) was updated to orchestrate calls to these new functions and handle `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful exit.
*   **Outcome:** `main.py` is now more organized, with improved readability and maintainability. This modular structure will facilitate future enhancements and debugging.
